			<h2>Administrative details</h2>
			<ul id="list1">
				<li>Client Name: Lyche</li>
				<li>Website Name: Lyche Kjøkken og Bar</li>
				<li>Contact Person: Lena Tørresdal</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
			<p>Lyche is a restaurant and bar primarily created on the principles of “by the students, for the students”,
			which can be observed in that all staff at Lyche consist of students, as well as most of the clientele. 
			However, Lyche feels that they are not fully reaching their potential audience, and to help them achieve their 
			goal of doing so, we wish to create a functional, user friendly, dynamic and informational web site to aid them in spreading
			the word of their wonderful establishment. In doing so, we hope that more students, as well as more locals and tourists,
			will be aware of Lyche, their menu and that more people will visit, hopefully leading to increased revenue and renown.</p>
			<h2>Navigation structure</h2>
			<p>The navigation structure of our web site is a mix of hierarchically and linear structures. This is an somewhat odd way to describe 
			the web site because it only consists of one web page. It's content is linear in form, you can scroll from one section to the next.
			Even if they are not connected with links, they are connected in the way they are ordered. The web site also has an hierarchy* element
			on the top of the page. It's a navigation bar with all the content, it reveals the site indexation. All the sections are always available
			through this navigation bar, since the bar floats on top of the screen and all the sections have anchor points which the bar links to.  	
			We have chosen to only have one webpage to our website because it's easy and smooth to navigate. The user have a excellent overview of 
			the site's content with the navigation bar. This setup also gives the user the option to ether scroll through all the content or to simply
			jump to a part of the page. The user can for example jump from the resturants menu to the gallery with ease. The reason we have two links
			to the footer is to make sure the user knows that this information is available. We think that this information is best soothed there. 
			Here is the storyboard/site map to the website</p>
